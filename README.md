<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Inspiration Behind The Project

Welcome to my first fully-personal React app! As someone who has been creating console-based games for the past few months, I decided it was time to venture into the world of front-end development. Tic Tac Toe became my first project, and I'm excited to share it with you.

### Features

- Interactive gameplay that you can enjoy directly in your web browser.
- Two-player mode: Challenge a friend and see who can outsmart the other.
- A simple and intuitive user interface to enhance your gaming experience.

I hope you have a great time playing Tic Tac Toe with this app! Feel free to provide feedback, report any issues, or contribute to its improvement.
